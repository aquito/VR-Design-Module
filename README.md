# VR Design Module

An Unity scene for a module on VR design at Sheffield Hallam University.

The scene sets up a challenge for the students, where:
- the goal is to move a ball from a starting point to a goal using a number of objects as its pathway
- students need to select prefabs from the project directory and move a set of them to the scene
- then, in the play mode, user will try to arrange the prefabs into a path for the ball and set it on its way
- if there are not enough objects to complete the task, the scene layout needs to be tweaked and tested again
